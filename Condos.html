					<dt>What is a condo?</dt>
						<dd>Our luxury condos are permanent structures four feet off the ground.
							Each condo has canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</dd>
					<dt>How are the condos furnished?</dt>
						<dd>Each condo is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gasfired stove.
							Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold
							running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
					<dt>What should I bring?</dt>
						<dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather
							with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense
							of adventure!</dd>
